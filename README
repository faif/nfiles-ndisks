The programs are two examples which use the evolutionary computation 
field to find an optimum optimization in a constraint-based problem.

More particularly a genetic algorithm is used in both cases.

The first problem concerns fitting a random number of files with a 
random size each, in a disk of random size.

The second problem is like the first, but uses a random number of disks 
instead of just one.

Have fun!
