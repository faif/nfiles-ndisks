Note: This is not a standalone application. It needs the GAlib library 
to work. The examples should run in any operating system with GAlib installed.
To install the application, do the following:

- Go into the ga directory and type `make' to build a copy of GAlib for your system.

$ cd ga
$ make

- Go into the directory of the example you wish to run, and simply type 
`make'. 

$ cd src/n_files_disk/
$ make

- Execute the example from a terminal application as an ordinary POSIX file

$ ./nfiles_disk
